# DuotrigesimalWS2811
A board for driving 32 strings of pixels from a Teensy 4.1. Similar to the OctoWS2811, but with 32 outputs. 

This board interfaces with a Teensy 4.1, and is designed to use the OctoWS2811 library to drive up to 32 strings of LEDS. 

Version 0.2 is designed to use the Amphenol RJHSE508004-ND, which is a four port RJ45 jack.  Version 0.2a uses the Adam Tech MTJG-4-88GX1-FSB, which is a less expensive and more readily available alternative.

The 2x3 pin that connects the board to the Teensy 4.1's ethernet pins is available on digikey and mouser, however is easier to source from PJRC when purchasing the Teensy 4.1.  If you want the teensy to be removable, PJRC is the recommended source for that connector.  If you're going to solder the T4.1 to this board, then it doesn't matter the source for the pins.  â€Ž
